These slides are part of the course entitled 'Marine Community Ecology,' co-developed by **Dr. Simon J. Brandl** and **Dr. Jordan M. Casey** and taught at The University of Texas at Austin [Marine Science Institute](https://utmsi.utexas.edu/)

All materials for the coding part of the course were created by the author using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). Slideshows were produced using the [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package.

All photos used in these presentations were taken by Dr. Casey and all code was written from scratch by Dr. Brandl and Dr. Casey. All scripts, files, and images necessary to complete the coding exercises are provided on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/gobysimon) and [Github](https://github.com/simonjbrandl/mce2024).

# Format of coding lessons

All coding lessons are structured as follows:

1) Watch a pre-recorded lecture that introduces you to the packages, operations, and objectives of each coding lesson. The recording and the slides used for the presentation will be available on Canvas. 

2) Perform a set of relatively easy exercises at home, which are usually to be submitted as homework. We will go through their solutions in class.

3) Work through a set of harder exercises in class. This will allow you to work in groups and with your instructors to solve problems and  deepen your coding skills.

You are recommended to use the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), but you do not have to.

- Create a new R Markdown document from the menu `File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Ninja Presentation`;<sup>1</sup>

--

- Click the `Knit` button to compile it;

--

- or use the [RStudio Addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/)<sup>2</sup> "Infinite Moon Reader" to live preview the slides (every time you update and save the Rmd document, the slides will be automatically reloaded in RStudio Viewer.

[2] See [#2](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/2) if you do not see the template or addin in RStudio.

# Hello Ninja

As a presentation ninja, you certainly should not be satisfied by the "Hello World" example. You need to understand more about two things:

1. The [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com) library;

1. The **xaringan** package;

Basically **xaringan** injected the chakra of R Markdown (minus Pandoc) into **remark.js**. The slides are rendered by remark.js in the web browser, and the Markdown source needed by remark.js is generated from R Markdown (**knitr**).

# Thanks!

Slides created via the R package [**xaringan**](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).

The chakra comes from [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com), [**knitr**](https://yihui.org/knitr/), and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
